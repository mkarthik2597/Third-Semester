### About

SystemC is a set of C++ classes and macros which provide an event-driven simulation kernel in C++, 
together with signals, events, and synchronization primitives, mimicking the hardware description languages VHDL and Verilog.
Various digital circuits are implemented using SystemC and the Assignmnent repository contains solutions in SystemC to hardware
design problems.
